# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover key insights about passenger survival rates. Using Excel, we performed EDA with pivot tables, visualizations, and a static dashboard to present findings effectively.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of passenger details from the Titanic disaster, structured as follows:

| Column       | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **Life**    | Survival status of the passenger (Survived/Perished) |
| **Class**   | Passenger class (First/Second/Third) |
| **Sex**     | Gender of the passenger (male/female) |
| **Age**     | Age of the passenger in years |
| **Family Size** | Total number of family members traveling together |
| **Fare**    | Ticket fare paid (Not used in this analysis) |
| **Embarked**| Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

The **Fare** column was not utilized in the analysis, as it did not contribute significantly to the explored insights.

## 📊 Key Insights
### 1️⃣ Gender & Survival
- **Females had a higher survival rate than males**, following the "Women and Children First" policy.
- Many males likely perished while assisting in rescue efforts.

### 2️⃣ Passenger Class & Survival
- **First-class passengers had the highest survival rate**, as they had easier access to lifeboats.
- **Third-class passengers suffered the most**, since they were located on the lower decks.

### 3️⃣ Age & Survival
- **Children (under 10) and elderly passengers (above 55) had better survival chances**.
- Passengers aged **15-55 were more likely to perish**, possibly due to assisting in rescues.

### 4️⃣ Embarkation Point & Survival
- Passengers who embarked from **'S' had the highest perish rate**.
- This could be due to the **higher number of third-class passengers from this port**.

### 5️⃣ Family Size & Survival
- **Small family sizes (around 4) had a better survival rate**.
- Large families struggled to survive, possibly due to difficulty staying together in chaos.

## 📌 Tools Used
- **Excel**: Pivot tables, charts, and dashboard creation.
- **GitHub**: Project hosting.
- **Fiverr & LinkedIn**: Portfolio showcasing.
